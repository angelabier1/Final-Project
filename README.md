# Final-Project
This folder is designed to be a collaborative work space shared by Benjamin Doyle and Craig Lord for the purpose of working together to complete the final project for HIST 3807O taught at Carleton University by Professor Shawn Graham 2016. Upon completion, these results will be published online.

A database for cross- referencing and adding metadata

Withgeo is combined data between OSE and GreatBooks data
