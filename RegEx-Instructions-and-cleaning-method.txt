Final Project Notes: Regex template and Summary of Changes to General Top 1000 Dataset


The following is the link to the site from which we acquired the nationalities of Great Books authors.
http://sonic.net/~rteeter/greatbks.html

The Following is the regex applied to the Great Books authors dataset (later to be used for tagging the General TOp 1000 Dataset)
1) .+\<recommended\>.+ replace with \r\n
2) (\<\w.+\>) replace with ~\1
3) \s*$ replace with nothing
4) ~ replace with nothing
5) ,_ replace with ,     (comma space replaced with comma)


The following is the regex created to clean the data of the General Top 1000 Dataset that can be applied to every dataset mined from OSP.
***Note: This is out of date as it removes all references to numbers at the beginning of each line. DO NOT USE!
1) ^(\d).+ replace with nothing
2) \s*$ replace with nothing
3)  (\<\w.+\>)$ replace with ~\1 OR a more efficient way to do this to avoid outliers is as follows:
3a) place cursor at start of first line of text, hold alt-shift and place cursor at beginning of last line of text, type ~ character and it should appear throughout the document
4) ^([^~]*~[^~]*)~(.*)$ replace with \1\2
5) (\<^\w.+\>)$ replace with ,\1
6) \r\n replace with nothing
7) ~ replace with \r\n
8) ,_ replace with ,     (comma space replaced with comma)


***PLEASE USE***
The following is the regex created to clean the data of the General Top 1000 Dataset that can be applied to every dataset mined from OSP.
Note: This is the most up to date regex explanation. Please use!
1) $ replace with ,     (this step will be helpful to avoid data bleeding into other columns later)
2) place cursor at start of first line of text, hold alt-shift and place cursor at beginning of last line of text, type ~ character and it should appear throughout the document
3) (^~\d) replace with ~\1
4) ^~ replace with ~,
5) ^, replace with nothing (should leave comma at beginning) (may need to also ^,~ replace with ~ if comma stays at front of number~ also)
6) (\<^\w.+\>)$ replace with ,\1
7) \r\n replace with nothing
8) ~ replace with \r\n
9) repeat step 1 to insert commas after each column of numbers and remove comma in the case of 4 digit number (may be a little finickey but should be able to line up columns fairly easily)
10) ,_ replace with ,  AND _, replace with ,   (comma space replaced with comma and space comma replaced with comma) (may also have to change ,, to ,)A
11) repeat technique from step 2/9 to remove tabs in number columns
12) Add headings to document
13) save as txt and csv file
14) Edit text in Microsoft Excel for obvious mistakes (generally when titles have commas included, the data columns get thrown off)
15) resave as txt and csv files


Unable to automate - did by hand using Bloom's chart and then filled in the rest of the top 100 using the internet - also cleaned data set of dates for consistency - also found repetitive issues within dataset - redid some of the numbers


The following is a brief description of the method used to remove duplicates from the cleaned Top 1000 dataset (now Top 933).
(combo rule - divide combo texts into individual, assuming both texts were read in combo text)
